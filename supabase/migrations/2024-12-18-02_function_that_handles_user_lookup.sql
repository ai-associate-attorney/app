/*

Supabase doesn't allow direct queries to auth.users from the client for security reasons. Instead, you'll need to use the Admin API or create a serverless function/API endpoint to handle this operation.
Here's a more secure approach using Supabase's built-in RLS policies:
Create a new migration to add a function that safely handles user lookup:
*/


-- Create a function to safely get user ID by email
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_info_by_id(user_id uuid)
RETURNS TABLE (
  id uuid,
  email text
)
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path = public
AS $$
  SELECT id, email
  FROM auth.users 
  WHERE id = user_id;
$$;

-- Grant execute permission to authenticated users
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION get_user_info_by_id TO authenticated;
